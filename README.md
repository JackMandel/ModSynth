This is a simple modular synth made with JUCE 7.0.5.
BUT! It sorts through each module after new connections are made, applying Kahn's algorithm on the AudioProcessorGraph used to manage each module.

I did this project for my final thesis at UNIMI. Feel free to contact me for any information regarding the code. Have fun!
